There are a lot of factors that affect web usability, one of the main things affecting it being its multimedia 
elements. When creating webpages, we have to consider how we want to create and place media elements such as text, 
images, sound, video, and etc. We need to account for everyone, meaning the physically impaired as well as everyone 
else. So when we create new elements and add it to the web, we need to stop and think: Is this a good design?

We cannot ignore the impact that web usability has, not only does it make it easier for users to user your site, but 
it directly correlates to how your website may look.Web usability is one of the most important factors of any 
website, it will decide whether a user keeps using your webpage or if they will move on to a different site. Given 
the choice between, lets a blog with images and text vs a blog with only text. You would have to strain your eyes 
trying to read the wall of text while an image can help you visualize and seperate the text to help you understand 
it better.

One way to make sure your site is fine is actually using it yourself! Make sure that you can stand using it before 
trying to make others use it.
