    Animation is a bit more special in multimedia. It consists of still images rapidly changing to produce to an illusion of movement.
    You could say that animation is a mix of other media, it could be a type of image, a mix of text, it can contain audio, or it may be a video.
    It can be hard to utilize but when done properly it can transmit a greater amount of information in a short amount of time.
    Take note of how many animations you plan to add to your multimedia designs, because animations are bascially videos, they require
    alot of space which may limit or interfere with any viewers of your media.

    Animations can provide lots of information quickly, take for example these 2 media:
</p>
<hr>
<div>
    <h4>Text:</h4>
    <p>Like and subscribe!</p>
</div>
<hr>
<div>
    <h4>Animation:</h4>
    <video class="col-md-8" width="420" height="240" autoplay controls loop muted>
        <source src="assets/videos/example1.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source>
    </video>
</div>
<hr>

<p>
    Which one are you attracted to more? the flashy animation or the plain text? Most would see the bright moving animation first
    before they even see the plain text. The animation draws the attention of the viewer first, and they instantly get the message that you want
    them to like and subscribe. They get the message immediately instead of having to read the text label, animations are great for getting the
    message to the user fast.

    When adding animations, we must be careful because they can be very attention grabbing. 
    Animations tend to draw the viewers focus towards it because it is flashy which is good if you want them to notice it,
    but just make sure that the user will notice the other media elements you've added. It would be fine if the animation is the main
    element you want them to watch, however if it's placed with text or other elements, it will overshadow them.

    Imagine if someone wanted this animation as a background for their website:
</p>

<video class="col-md-8" width="420" height="240" autoplay controls loop>
    <source src="assets/videos/clutter.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source>
</video>

<p>
    At first it looks cool, the users attention would propably focus on the background but that would be it. As the user browses
    the website they would be drawn to look at the animation because their eyes are drawn to the motion. So limit the amount
    of animation contained in your multimedia unless necessary.
