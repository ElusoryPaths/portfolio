Images are a very important part of multimedia. They are the most attention grabbing thing and usually the thing you 
see when you open multimedia.

Images are attention grabbing, that is a good thing but it can also be a curse. When selecting images, there are 
some things to consider. Is the main point of the media to get users to look at your picture? Is there more to the 
media then just the image? Should they be just taking a glance of using the image as a reference to explain some text? 
</p>

<p>
What we want to do is not just get users to look at the image, but we want them to understand why we put that image there. 
The user can infer many details from a simple image.

<p>
Thats just the main components that we need to consider, there are also some smaller details that are important to a smaller 
group of users. We need to take note of users that may not be able to view the image or maybe they can't see some parts of it. 
When choosing images we should take note of how we are going to accommodate visually impaired users. Let's look at an example 
of why this might be important.

<img src='assets/images/svg/colorblind.svg'>

<p>
You can probably see this image, and you can see the number in the middle. But if you were a specific type of colorblindness all 
you would see is a circle. So if you were trying to show the user a number they wouldn't be able to understand what it is. 
This doesn't even cover how it would work for blind people, if you were blind how would you figure out what the number is? 
In this case you would need to add sound to play the number, but thats a discussion for a different day.

<p>
You can see how images affects your understanding considerably, so we need to make sure that we choose the right image when 
creating multimedia. Like the saying goes, a picture is worth a thousand words.
