<p>Lights, Camera, Action!</p>

    What happens in filming isn't simply just the shooting of the film itself.
    Theres alot more that happens behind the scenes before any filming actually starts.
    There's usually 3 phases to filming, the pre-production, the production, and the post-production.

<h4>Pre-production</h4>
<p>
    Before any filming happens you have to first plan out what you want to film.
    Pre-production is the phase where you plan out everything that happens in your film, 
    from what costumes you need, where to shoot the film, whats the script of the film, to who the actors are.
    This is one of the most important steps before making a film, you need to know what you are planning to do so
    make sure to note down everything that you may need, and that everyone knows their roles. <br>
    When making your film keep a note and make sure you have these:
    <ul>
        <li>Script</li>
        <li>Story board</li>
        <li>Breakdown Sheet, includes locations, props, etc.</li>
        <li>Scene planning</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h4>production</h4>
<p>
    If the pre-production was the introduction to filming then the production would be the body,  
    production is the actual shooting of the film. During filming, there are a few things to take note of;
    equipment, camera technique and lighting. <br>
    These key elements can make or break a film:
    <ul>
        <li>if your equipment is shoddy it results in a lower quality film, like trying to use a phone camera will result in a low resolution</li>
        <li>if the camera isn't stable your film will look horrible because it'll keep shaking making it hard to watch.</li>
        <li>if the lighting is bad, you won't be able see the film at all. If the screen is too dark it will be hard to see, if its too bright then it will hurt the viewers eyes.</li>
    </ul>

</p>

<h4>Post-production</h4>
<p>
    The last part of a film is the post-production or the conclusion. Don't think that you've reached the end though!
    This final phase is curcial to piece your film together. During the post-production, the film is finally pieced together. All the scenes are
    stitched together and extra effects are added into the scenes. <br>
    During the post-production keep a few things in mind:  
    <ul>
        <li>The editing is important to make sure the transitions are smooth, so that when the film moves on to the next scene it doesn't seem out of place.</li>
        <li>Use proper music to help set the mood, or enhance scenes.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h4>Conclusions</h4>
<p>
    You don't always need to have the best production to make a great movie, but having proper planning in the pre-production and 
    amazing editing skills can make some of the worst productions into an amazing film.
